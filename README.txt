TEXT CLASSIFICATION WITH HUGGING FACE

Text classification is a common NLP task that assigns a label or class to text. Some of the largest companies run text classification in production for a wide range of practical applications. One of the most popular forms of text classification is sentiment analysis, which assigns a label like 🙂 positive, 🙁 negative, or 😐 neutral to a sequence of text. IN this project used imdb dataset, transformers, bert model, HyperParameters, Metrics. Here showed upto prediction and training the dataset.

Transformers: A transformer is a deep learning model that adopts the mechanism of self-attention, differentially weighting the significance of each part of the input (which includes the recursive output) data. It is used primarily in the fields of natural language processing and computer vision.

Bert: BERT stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, BERT in Machine Learning are models for pre-trained language representations that can be used to create models for the tasks of Natural Language Processing.
